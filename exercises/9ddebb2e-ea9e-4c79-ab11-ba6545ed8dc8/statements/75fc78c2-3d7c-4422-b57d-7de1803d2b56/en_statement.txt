<p>We must insist that <code>DELETE</code> is a statement that <strong>delete complete rows</strong> from a table, so we will not use it in the case where what we want to delete be the value of some attribute.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>We are going to eliminate the commission of the employees whose job identifier is <code>'<strong>SA_MAN</strong>'< /code>. Since we only want to remove the value of one attribute, we will need to use an <code>UPDATE</code>, instead of a <code>DELETE</code> statement, like this:</p><blockquote><pre ><code>BEGIN;<br />SELECT * FROM employees WHERE JOB_ID = 'SA_MAN';<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE employees<br />SET COMMISSION_PCT = NULL<br />WHERE JOB_ID = ' SA_MAN';</strong><br />--UPDATE 5<br /><br />SELECT * FROM employees WHERE JOB_ID = 'SA_MAN';<br />ROLLBACK;</code></pre></ blockquote><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Employee 114 has ceased in his position, so all those who had him as a hierarchical superior, are left without a hierarchical superior until one is assigned to them.</p ><p>Therefore, it removes the value of the <code>MANAGER_ID</code> attribute from those that had employee 114 as their hierarchical superior.</p>
