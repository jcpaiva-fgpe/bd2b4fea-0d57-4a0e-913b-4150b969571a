<p>The statement <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-delete.html" target="_blank"><code>DELETE</code></a> is the that allows you to delete or delete records from a table.</p><h3>Syntax</h3><p>This is the syntax that you must take into account to use it:</p><blockquote><pre><code> DELETE FROM <em>table_name</em><br /> [ WHERE <em>condition</em>];</code></pre></blockquote><p>As we have seen in the previous statements , <code>table_name</code> refers to the table on which the operation will be performed, in this case delete. Note that the <code>WHERE</code> clause is optional. If it is not indicated, you must be very clear that all the content of the table will be deleted, although the table will continue to exist with the structure it had until now.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>We can delete all the records of the <code>job_history</code> table with the following statement:</p><blockquote><pre><code>BEGIN;<br />SELECT * FROM job_history;<br /><br / ><strong>DELETE FROM job_history;</strong><br />-- DELETE 10<br /><br />SELECT * FROM job_history;<br />ROLLBACK;</code></pre></blockquote ><p>The need to delete all the records is not common in reality and, for those cases, there is an alternative statement (<code>TRUNCATE</code>), which allows you to delete the entire content of a table without deleting its structure.</p><p>The <code>DELETE</code> statement usually requires the use of the <code>WHERE</code> clause: the records that are deleted will be those that meet the restrictions established in the < code>WHERE</code>.</p><p>In the following example, we will remove the re records of the table <code>job_history</code> whose end date is before the year 1998:</p><blockquote><pre><code>BEGIN;<br />SELECT * FROM job_history;<br /> <br /><strong>DELETE FROM job_history<br />WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM END_DATE) < 1998;</strong><br />-- DELETE 3<br /><br />SELECT * FROM job_history;< br />ROLLBACK;</code></pre></blockquote><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Delete all departments that do not have any <code>MANAGER_ID</code> assigned.</p>
